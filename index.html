                <p class="descript-culture">The silk culture in Nanchong has a profound cultural heritage and is an important component of Nanchong culture. For thousands of years, the people of Nanchong have been   engaged in the production and practical life of planting mulberry, raising silkworms, reeling silk, and weaving silk. They have nurtured a silk culture with local characteristics in Nanchong, mainly reflected in historical records, cultural relics, poetry, biographies, silk sculptures, silk place names and customs, silk cultural relics and literature related to sericulture and silk.</p>
                <div class="silk-culture">
                    <img src="images/silk.jpg" class="silk-img1">
                </div>

                <p class="des descript-culture">Sculpture is a record and reflection of urban culture. In 1985, one Weaver Girl sculpture was built in the Five Star Garden of Nanchong, and the famous sculpture master Liu Kaiqu personally inscribed "Silk City". In 1997, the railway was officially opened, and the "Tengfei" sculpture was settled in the railway station square. Three flying girls carried a mulberry leaf and a small silkworm, symbolizing the Silk City. In Yingxi Town, Shunqing District, we see a museum called "China Sericulture Museum", which displays sculptures of the legendary Silk Ancestor, inventor Lei Zu, and Ma Tou Niang. Many silk sculptures can be seen in the first workshop of the millennium silk capital, China Silk Culture Park, and the factory area of Liuhe Company. There is a set of reliefs in the North Lake Square of Nanchong, describing Nanchong as the starting point of the Southern Silk Road, which is refreshing to people.</p>

                <p class="des descript-culture">From 1990 to 1993, Nanchong held four consecutive Silk Festivals, which were a festival that every Nanchong person was proud of. The festival was carried out through a combination of culture and economics, with the design of the emblem and anthem, as well as the organization of cultural and sports events such as trade exhibitions, lantern exhibitions, calligraphy and painting exhibitions, fireworks parties, and model performances. Twelve categories, 200 varieties, and over 2000 colors of silk products were exhibited, attracting the United States, Japan, and more Canada and other domestic and foreign merchants have reached 17000 people, with a total transaction volume of 7 billion yuan. This has greatly increased the popularity of Nanchong and stirred up a strong emotional attachment among every Nanchong person towards the silk of Nanchong. This is the cultural heritage that silk endows this city with.</p>

                </div>

                <p class="des descript-culture">The magical and beautiful silk originated from ancient times and still accompanies the footsteps of the people of Nanchong with its gentle steps. It can be said that the greatest charm of Nanchong silk is not its softness, but its antiquity. Its long history, rich cultural connotations, and eternal charm will undoubtedly bring confidence and strength to the silk people of Nanchong, and let the ancient agarwood of Nanchong silk shine again, which is an eternal dream in the hearts of Nanchong people.</p>
